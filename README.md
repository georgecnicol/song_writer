Makes random 4 chord progression for guitar practice, according to a key also chosen at random. 

Sample Output:
The key is in A Minor.
The chord progression is as follows:
A Minor G Major C Major D Minor

Sample Output:
The key is in F Major.
The chord progression is as follows:
F Major A Minor Bb Major G Minor

Sample Output:
The key is in E Major.
The chord progression is as follows:
E Major Eb Dimin C# Minor A Major

Note that sharps and flats are called out as I happen to think about them on the keyboard. For example in the third sample output E flat diminished is technically correct, but would more accurately be called D shrap diminished to be more in line with expectations for the stated key of E Major. But, a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.
